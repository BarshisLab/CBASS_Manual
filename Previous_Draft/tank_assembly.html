# Tank Assembly 
---
One CBASS unit controls the thermal cycle of two coolers. Each cooler is separated by an acrylic glass divider creating four total partitions. This protocol uses the [Coleman Stacker Portable Cooler](https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-24-Can-Stacker-Portable-Cooler/dp/B00363PSBE), however other brands/styles would also work.  

# Tank Preparation  

Each cooler requires multiple holes drilled to install outflow ports and chillers on the longer sides of the cooler. The measurements for hole placement are stated as the distances from certain points on the cooler. The "outer edge" of the cooler is the outside wall of the cooler not including the handles. The "inner edge" of the cooler is a rectangular ridge that sticks out on the outside of the cooler wall. Measurements for the height of holes are based upon the cooler sitting on top of its lid where the outer edge and lid meet.

### 1. Measure placement and drill holes for outflow ports 

Each cooler requires 2 outflow ports to maintain water level between all partitions. Outflows are located 1 1/4" from the outer edge and 1/2" from the top outer edge of the cooler. We use a [3/4" Bulkhead](https://www.marinedepot.com/double-threaded-bulkhead-fitting-3-4-inch) which requires a 1 1/2" diameter hole.

### 2. Measure placement and drill holes for chillers
Each chiller requires an outer and inner hole drilled into **the cooler wall opposite of the outflow ports.** The outer hole is drilled only halfway through 

The first and fourth chillers' outer holes are positioned 3/4" from the inner ridge of the cooler. The outer hole of the second and third chillers are positioned 1 1/4" from each other. All outer holes are drilled 1" from the bottom outer edge of the cooler.

Use a 3" hole saw to drill halfway into the cooler wall for the outer hole of each chiller. You just want to remove the outer plastic of the cooler, exposing the insulation underneath. Use a flathead screwdriver to scrape out the insulation halfway. Drill a 1 1/4" hole into the center of each outer hole which is where the chiller will insert through. 


### 3. Cut and Install Partition Acrylic  

Each tank requires one piece of acrylic cut to the size of the tank interior to create two separate partitions. 

	-cardboard to make stencil to cut acrylic?  
	-install with aquarium sealant?
	-Do this once you reach destination  

### 4. Cut egg crate base 

A plastic [egg crate](https://www.amazon.com/Egg-Crate-Black-Styrene-11-5/dp/B077WKTG7M) base is placed at the bottom of each partition to hold coral samples during the thermal cycling. This needs to be cut to the size of each partition.

# Setting up Tank for CBASS 

Now that the tank is prepped, all the following steps are for assembling  the tank to run the CBASS. The tank can be disassembled and reassembled as needed for shipping and storage. No components are permanently installed in the tank. 

### 4. Install Outflows

Screw the bulkhead through the cooler wall with the locking nut and body on the outside of the cooler.

Next, screw the [nylon elbow](https://www.usplastic.com/catalog/item.aspx?itemid=34064) into the the body of the bulkhead on the outside of the cooler.  

### ** *NYLON ELBOW ATTACHED TO BULKHEAD PICTURE* **  

Vinyl tubing can be connected to each nylon elbow to redirect water outflow. 


### 5. Install Chillers 

Each cooler houses four [chillers](https://www.amazon.com/IceProbe-Thermoelectric-Aquarium-Chiller/dp/B001JSVLBO/ref=asc_df_B001JSVLBO/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198088359792&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5081962863071505841&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9021710&hvtargid=aud-829758849484:pla-319865085565&psc=1) total, two per partition. For each chiller, remove the watertight securing nut. Push the ice probe through the 1 1/4" hole drilled through the cooler wall. The silicon washer and foam pad underneath should rest in the scraped out insulation of the outer hole. Put the watertight screwing nut over the probe and screw it until the chiller is tightly secured. The weight of all four chillers may cause the tank to tip, but it will remain flat once water is added.

### 6. Insert Egg Crate

Slide the egg crate underneath the chiller probes so it rests on the bottom of each partition. 

### 7. Anchor Heaters 

Two [heaters](https://www.bulkreefsupply.com/finnex-th-deluxe-titanium-heating-element-with-plastic-guard.html) are used in each tank, one per  partition. Use the two suction cups attached to the heater to anchor it on the side walls just above the egg crate.

### 8. Anchor pumps 

Two [pumps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YYIHGXS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) are used in each tank, one per partition, to keep water circulating. Using the suction cup attached to the pump, anchor the pump in between the two chillers so water is being pushed towards the outflow wall. The pump can be anchored slightly above or below the chillers, as long as it is fully submerged.
