This program automatically sets the Arduino's time to the time when the program was compiled.  There is no need to enter a time.  Accuracy should be within a couple of seconds.  The program adds 6 seconds to the time from the host computer, to allow for upload time.

This should be run once from a computer with the correct time in the time zone you are using.  Follow up by loading some other software, because if this runs again (for example after unplugging the Arduino and powering it up later) it will reset to the old time.

This can be repeated any time the clock has lost accuracy.
